# Saving Satoshi slideshow for [TABConf 2024](https://6.tabconf.com)

The [Saving Satoshi](https://savingsatoshi.com) gang has a booth with a TV. We'll have an Android tablet at hand that will stream to the TV via a [Chromecast TV](https://store.google.com/product/chromecast_google_tv).

For streaming use the [Home app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app).

In the slideshow, there's an invisible button in the top-left corner to enable fullscreen. Elegant solution, right. If the layout has not adjusted to fit the screen, tap around a bit. To exit fullscreen, swipe up and press the back button.

Enable [app pinning](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9455138?hl=en), to lock the device to a single app, for security. Enable it by going to recents and tapping the app icon. To exit, tap the recents and back button at the same time. The device goes to the lock screen, so the PIN is needed to access anything else.
